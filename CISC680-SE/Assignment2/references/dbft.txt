Another popular consensus algorithm is Delegate byzantine fault tolerance. This builds from the staking of the PoS algorithm. DBFT makes nodes that are staking to vote for a speaker to represent its changes to the main chain. Delegates are chosen and they choose a speaker to communicate with the main chain. The delegates are the book keepers who communicate to the speaker who communicates to the main chain. If the delegates all vote that the request and response between all parties are correct they will add the transaction to their records. If a speaker acts maliciously they are voted off their speaker position. If a node is caught acting nefariously they lose their stake. This is a great advantage to speed and scalability but it is not truly decentralized in nature since you need to have a node with an escrow account to be able to vote for delegates who vote for a speaker. Making it have a high entry barrier creating a buffer for decentralization adoption by everyday users.
