Hello,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the Java Web3 Engineer position. With a robust background in Java development and a strong passion for blockchain technology, I’m confident this opportunity aligns with my experience and career goals.

Currently, I’m a Senior Principal Engineer at Northrop Grumman, contributing to mission-critical projects like the E2 airplane radar system and space systems. My career has also encompassed roles at Lockheed Martin, the Army’s Cyber Protection Brigade, and Deloitte, where I honed my skills in Java, Big Data Structures, and Relational Databases.

What excites me most is the chance to apply my technical expertise in a dynamic blockchain environment. I’ve deployed smart contracts on Ethereum, including ERC20, ERC721(A), and DAO structures. These experiences, coupled with my academic research on asynchronous consensus protocols, position me well to thrive within an enterprise blockchain team.

I’d love to explore how my skills in Spring Boot, REST APIs, and distributed systems could contribute to your team’s success. When would be a good time to connect?

Best regards,
Eric Webb
