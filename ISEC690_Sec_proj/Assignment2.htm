Specifically, this assignment calls all students to learn the resources provided by the <a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/" target="_blank">NSU's Career Development office</a> that includes: (a) <a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/students/advisement-services.html" target="_blank">Resume building</a>, (b) <a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/handshake.html" target="_blank">Handshake system</a>, and (c) <a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/students/advisement-services.html" target="_blank">mock interview</a>. The assignment will also include a self-reflection about the experience with the <a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/" target="_blank">NSU's Career Development office</a> and value they provide to students.<br> <b>This assignment should be done individually!</b></font></p>

			<p><font face="Calibri">Your assignment will take three weeks to complete during the weeks noted on the schedule in the course syllabus. The assignment includes three tasks (aside from the self-reflection), where each task is scheduled to take place over the three weeks. <b>Note: Do NOT wait for the weekend before it's due to start working on each task as the <a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/" target="_blank">NSU's Career Development office</a> will not accommodate a last minute scheduling!!!</b><br>
The following are the three tasks that you will need to complete for this assignment (aside from the reflection - see below):<br>
                <b>Week 1:</b> Schedule two meetings with the NSU’s Career Development office: (a) Resume and Handshake profile building; (b) Mock interview. To schedule an appointment you will need to contact the office's front desk via (954) 262-7201. You will need to print and fill in the <a href="Resume_and_Mock_Interview_Signed_Form.docx" target="_blank">Resume and Mock Interview Form (click here)</a> and take it with you to the two meetings. <b>Remember that it is YOUR responsibility to bring the printed form to the two meetings! The NSU's Career Development office will NOT print the form for you!!!</b><br>
<b>Week 2:</b> Conduct the Resume and Handshake profile building meeting with the NSU’s Career Development office and get advisor’s approval for the meeting.<br> 
<b>Week 3:</b> Conduct the Mock interview meeting with the NSU’s Career Development office and get advisor’s approval for the meeting<br> 
			<p><font face="Calibri"><a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/" target="_blank">NSU's Career Development office</a> will provide you with a sign-up sheet for the above three tasks (or e-mail confirmation). You will need to complete each task during the week indicated on the schedule in the syllabus. Once you complete the task, an advisor will sign it (or provide you an e-mail confirmation) that the task was completed.<br><br>
Moreover, you are asked to write a 1-page self-reflection of your overall experience with the <a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/" target="_blank">NSU's Career Development office</a> that you will add to the assignment file (to be submitted individually!). This self-reflection should explain what you have learned during the experience and list at least three things that you didn't know before this assignment, which now you are aware of (can be in bullet format).<br><br>
Also, some of you may wish to do the resume review and mock interview via Skype, which is OK as well, but you need to coordinate that with the <a href="http://www.nova.edu/career/" target="_blank">NSU's Career Development office</a> and get their approval to do it in that way. We know many organizations that do initially Skype interviews (or via other online platforms, WebEx, GoToMeeting, Zoom, etc), and only then invite for face-to-face interview if applicable.

			<p><font face="Calibri">(For complete policy, see Code of Student Conduct and Academic Responsibility, p. 45. Also see the sections on student misconduct, p. 10, and the NSU Student Handbook.) </font></p>
<p><font face="Calibri">Each student is responsible for maintaining academic integrity and intellectual honesty in his or her academic work. It is the policy of the college that each student must: </font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Calibri">Submit his or her own work, not that of another person Not falsify data or records (including admissions materials) </font></li>
              <li><font face="Calibri">Not engage in cheating (e.g., giving or receiving help during examinations, acquiring and/or transmitting test questions prior to an examination) </font></li>
              <li><font face="Calibri">Not receive or give aid on assigned work that requires independent effort </font></li>
              <li><font face="Calibri">Properly credit the words or ideas of others according to accepted standards for professional publications.* </font></li>
              <li><font face="Calibri">Not use term paper writing services or consult such services for the purpose of obtaining assistance in the preparation of materials to be submitted in courses or for theses or dissertations </font></li>
              <li><font face="Calibri">Not commit plagiarism (Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s Collegiate Dictionary (1996) defines plagiarism as &ldquo;stealing or passing off ideas or words of another as one&rsquo;s own&rdquo; and &ldquo;the use of a created production without crediting the source.&rdquo;) (see Crediting the Words or Ideas of Others below) </font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Calibri"><strong><em>Crediting the Words or Ideas of Others </em></strong></font></p>
            <p><em><strong><font face="Calibri"></font></strong></em><font face="Calibri">When using the exact words of another, quotation marks must be used for short quotations (fewer than 40 words), and block quotation style must be used for longer quotations. In either case, a proper citation must also be provided. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Fifth Edition, (2001, pp. 117 and 292) contains standards and examples on quotation methods.  When paraphrasing (summarizing, or rewriting) the words or ideas of another, a proper citation must be provided. (Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, Fifth Edition (2001) contains standards and examples on citation methods (pp. 207&ndash;214) and reference lists (pp. 215&ndash;281)). The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993) defines paraphrase as &ldquo;An expression in other words, usually fuller and clearer, of the sense of a written or spoken passage or text&hellip;Express the meaning (of a word, phrase, passage, or work) in other words, usually with the object of clarification&hellip;&rdquo;. Changing word order, deleting words, or substituting synonyms is not acceptable paraphrasing&mdash;it is plagiarism, even when properly cited. Rather than make changes of this nature, the source should be quoted as written. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Calibri"><strong><em>Original Work </em></strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Calibri">Assignments, exams, projects, papers, theses, dissertations, etc., must be the original work of the student. Original work may include the thoughts and words of another author but such thoughts or words must be identified utilizing quotation marks or indentation and must properly identify the source. At all times, students are expected to comply with the college&rsquo;s accepted citation practice and policy.  Work is not original when it has been submitted previously by the author or by anyone else for academic credit. Work is not original when it has been copied or partially copied from any other source, including another student, unless such copying is acknowledged by the person submitting the work for the credit at the time the work is being submitted, or unless copying, sharing, or joint authorship is an express part of the assignment. Exams and tests are original work when no unauthorized aid is given, received, or used before or during the course of the examination, reexamination, and/or remediation.</font></p>
